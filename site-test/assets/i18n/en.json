    "MESSAGE-OF-PRESIDENT": "    <div class=\"col-lg-6 h-100\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        The year of 2022 was essential for integrating and strengthening the\r\n        Copa Energia brand. We are leaders in the market, assuming 25% of the\r\n        market share in the offer of bottling, marketing and distribution of\r\n        Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), a position that brings us a huge pride\r\n        and responsibility before our customers and all stakeholders inserted in\r\n        our value chain and relationship.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Some of the evidence of this commitment is the extensive investment we\r\n        made throughout the year, aiming to strengthen our leadership to base\r\n        our decisions on values that are non-negotiable for the Company:\r\n        determination, respect, partnership and innovation. These values\r\n        establish the Copa Energia way of being and doing, which guarantee the\r\n        continuity of our business from a comprehensive and entrepreneurial\r\n        vision. We are convinced that these elements solidify the company's\r\n        reason for existence in the new paths and markets we want to reach.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        With the strengthening of the Copa Energia culture, we have raised the\r\n        principles and practices of sustainability to a much more strategic\r\n        level, assuming the assumption of “Energizing Lives and Businesses in a\r\n        Sustainable Way”, based on objective commitments and based on the 2030\r\n        Agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We created the\r\n        Corporate Volunteer Program, stimulating the exchange of knowledge\r\n        between our employees and important social organizations, which act in\r\n        synergy with our vision and our core business. We integrate the 2030\r\n        Ambition with the Global Compact, assuming gender equity (SDG 5) with a\r\n        protagonist and innovative vision for our sector.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Also in 2022, we prioritized the restructuring of our corporate\r\n        governance, so that essential values such as ethics, transparency and\r\n        integrity are guiding principles in decision-making, following\r\n        guidelines and internal regulations. With these achievements, we are\r\n        proud to share that we were elected the 3rd best company in Brazil in\r\n        the Fuel, Oil and Gas Sector. We entered the ISTOÉ Dinheiro magazine\r\n        ranking and are among the 100 largest Brazilian companies, appointed by\r\n        the Valor 1000 Magazine.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We are striving to carry out the necessary energy transition and\r\n        diversify our business model, believing that in this way we will\r\n        continue to contribute to even cleaner energy matrices,\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"d-inline-block d-lg-none\">\r\n        We are striving to carry out the necessary energy transition and\r\n        diversify our business model, believing that in this way we will\r\n        continue to contribute to even cleaner energy matrices, which is within\r\n        the reach of all the partners that have been with us throughout these 67\r\n        years of history.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-lg-6 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between\">\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p class=\"d-none d-lg-inline-block\">\r\n          which is within the reach of all the partners that have been with us\r\n          throughout these 67 years of history.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          We know that this path has been walked in partnership with customers\r\n          and consumers who have always supported us and we are confident that\r\n          Copa Energia will integrate and further strengthen these ties.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Enjoy your reading!</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"text-center text-lg-end\">\r\n        <span class=\"img-container\">\r\n          <img\r\n            src=\"/assets/images/mensagem-do-presidente.jpg\"\r\n            class=\"img-fluid\"\r\n            title=\"Antonio Carlos Moreira Turqueto (Caio) CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors\"\r\n          />\r\n          <span class=\"label green\">\r\n            Antonio Carlos Moreira Turqueto (Caio) CEO and Chairman of the Board\r\n            of Directors\r\n          </span>\r\n        </span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
    "vp-message": "    <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n      <p>\r\n        Copagaz was founded in 1955 with the perspective of providing a cleaner\r\n        and more accessible source for cooking to Brazilian homes. At this time,\r\n        the use of coal and firewood already pointed to a harmful direction,\r\n        with possible negative impacts on the health of housewives. The context\r\n        of value as per the company's insight provokes us and gives us the\r\n        responsibility to honor and maintain our vision in sustainability, which\r\n        has lasted more than 67 years.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This history is legitimized by the voluntary commitments we made in the\r\n        first year representing the Global Compact in Brazil and the Ethos\r\n        Institute, not to mention the sustainability reports that we have\r\n        released since 2013 and of our annual inventories of greenhouse gas\r\n        (GHG) emissions, by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program, monitoring\r\n        impacts and managing our emissions. Today we are Copa Energia; we are\r\n        part of Liquigás and we became even more responsible for the pursuit of\r\n        excellence in our socio-environmental management. We hired the\r\n        consultancy firm Ramboll that helped us carry out a critical analysis of\r\n        the integrated emissions of the two companies, thus creating new\r\n        opportunities to contribute to the mitigation of climate impacts.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We are aware that we are not doing little, but we know that there are\r\n        still many challenges ahead.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In 2022, we improved our vision on ESG and sought to get to know some\r\n        outstanding references in our sector, nationally and internationally. We\r\n        remade our materiality matrix and matured even more with this process.\r\n        We count on the partnership of Consultoria Lume and we have outlined the\r\n        Strategic ESG guidelines for Copa Energia, which you will have the\r\n        opportunity to learn about in this edition.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>Enjoy your reading!</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-lg-6 d-flex align-items-lg-end justify-content-lg-end\">\r\n      <div class=\"text-center text-lg-end\">\r\n        <span class=\"img-container\">\r\n          <img\r\n            src=\"/assets/images/mensagem-vp.jpg\"\r\n            class=\"img-fluid\"\r\n            title=\"Eduardo Elias Zahran Filho\r\n            Vice President of Sustainability and Renewable Energy\"\r\n          />\r\n          <span class=\"label orange\">\r\n            Eduardo Elias Zahran Filho <br/>\r\n            Vice President of Sustainability and Renewable Energy\r\n          </span>\r\n        </span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>",
